## Basic Overview of Project

The goal of the project is to model a burger shop where users can make an order, eat the order, and have their dishes bussed.

## Resources Used

Joe Rehfuss, Aslan Ghodsian, and Zachary Stowell for some debugging (route naming auditing).  
Zach Auerbach for some css and styling tips.  


## Further Development Plans

It would be neat to actually take this small project and have it work for ordering for a table or to have it be bussed in these times of social distancing; however, time frames are limited currently.
